# Assignment A: Simple To-Do List

This is a React Native To-Do application built with Expo. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The app persists data using AsyncStorage, so tasks remain saved even after closing the app.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Input text and add to the list.
- **Completion Tracking**: Tap a task to toggle completion (strikethrough effect).
- **Deletion**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: Uses AsyncStorage to save data locally.

## Setup & Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
